# HandCricket
This is a game played by python and you. This same like actual Cricket. 

In this game we first choose odd or even.Then python gives a number using random module.
Then we play cricket with python by giving numbers from 1 to 10. If player's number = python's number it is considered as out. 

This is a simple and fun game.
